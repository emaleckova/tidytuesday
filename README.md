# tidytuesday

[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) - organized by [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/) - is a weekly social data project & and a great opportunity to explore new datasets, practice data wrangling, and visualizations. This repository contains the code I used to produce my visualisations of #TidyTuesday datasets. You can also follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evamaleckova/).
